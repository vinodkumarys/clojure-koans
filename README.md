# clojure-koans for Light Table
A set of exercises for learning Clojure.

This is a fork of https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans

I have removed all the project and test files so that the excercises can be done easily in Light Table InstaREPL.

# requirements

1. JDK.
2. Light Table IDE (http://lighttable.com/).

# how to use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the folder in Light Table.
3. Open an excercise file.
4. Press CTRL + Space to bring up the commands panel. Search for "Instarepl: Make current editor an instarepl" and press Enter.
5. Now try solving the problems and get isntance results.
